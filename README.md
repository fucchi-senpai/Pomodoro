## About This Script

Just set timer for 50 mins to focus your jobs, studying or something you want to focus.
50 mins later, you can have a break time for 10 mins if you want.

## How to run

Open your `Terminal app` and just run the following command.

```
$ osascript ~/{YourLocation}/Scripts/setPomodoro.applescript
```

**If you quit the code while running it** , you can push `control + c`.

## Changing Timer Set up

Unfortunately, if you want to change timer, you need to edit `setPomodoro.applescript`. üòÖüôá‚Äçüôá  
For instance, if you want to change it from 50 mins to 30 mins, you can update the code like the following code.

```diff
- 		set timer to 60 * 50
+ 		set timer to 60 * 30
```

also updating break time from 15 mins to 10 mins.

```diff
- 		set breakTime to 60 * 10
+ 		set breakTime to 60 * 15
```
